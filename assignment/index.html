    <h2 class="part1 montserrat-normal">Identifying Usability Problems</h2>
    <p class="montserrat-normal">
      In this assignment, students were tasked with identifying a website with
      Usability issues, visually redesigning the website, and finally building
      the redesign using HTML and CSS. To start, I chose
      <a href="www.irishwrecksonline.net">irishwrecksonline.net</a>
      a website that provides information on dive-able shipwrecks around
      Ireland. The website has a lot of usability issues, including a lack of
      alt text, poor color contrast, and a lack of mobile responsiveness. The
      design also dated and there are a lot of creative ways that this
      information can be presented. Second, the website's design is simple but
      unintuitive so I believe I can significantly improve the user experience.
      Finally, I am interested in shipwrecks and diving and enjoy the content of
      the website. The website is pictured below.

    <h3 class="part3 montserrat-normal">Finding Problems</h3>
    <p class="montserrat-normal">
      Below are all usability problems found in the website
    </p>
    <ul class="montserrat-normal">
      <li>
        At first glance, your eyes are directed to the map on the right side,
        but it’s unclear what you’re looking at. The title of the website is
        large, but doesn’t tell you exactly what the website does.
      </li>
      <li>
        There are a lot of colors on the webpage, making it hard to read certain
        text and understand what’s important
      </li>
      <li>
        When hovering your mouse over buttons and clickable objects, they don’t
        change colors making it challenging to understand what’s clickable or
        not.
      </li>
      <li>
        The efficiency of the website is lackluster because you may have to
        click through many links to get the information you’re looking for. The
        search bar is also challenging to find and use.
      </li>
      <li>
        Since all the buttons look the same, it may be challenging for users to
        remember which button they pressed to access the same information that
        they need.
      </li>
      <li>
        The learnability is moderate. The website’s main page doesn’t have an
        overwhelming amount of information; however, it’s unclear what a user is
        able to do from the homepage.
      </li>
      <li>
        The map element is apparently clickable and directs to another page with
        a more interactive map. This was very unclear when using the website
        initially.
      </li>
      <li>
        The axis on the map image are also confusing and have no relation to the
        photo.
      </li>
      <li>
        There is no mobile responsiveness, making it difficult to use on a phone
        or tablet.
      </li>
      <li>
        There is no alt text on the images, making it difficult for visually
        impaired users to understand the content.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="montserrat-normal">
      The WAVE Report mentioned that the website is missing alt text on a lot of
      its images, and it’s also missing documentation of the language that’s
      used. The website is also missing a heading structure and a label. For
      one, the lack of alt text makes it difficult for visually impaired readers
      to understand what the site content has. In addition, the page has no
      heading structure or page regions. This makes it harder for a search
      engine or LLM to obtain information from the website which makes the
      website harder to reach and thus inaccessible.

    <h2 class="part1 montserrat-normal">Visual Redesign</h2>

    <h3 class="part3 montserrat-normal">Speed Sketching</h3>
    <p class="montserrat-normal">
      Using a pencil and paper, I sketched 9 options for my redesign.
    </p>

      alt="speed sketches"
      class="sketchphoto"
    />
    <h3 class="part3 montserrat-normal">Final Sketching</h3>
    <p class="montserrat-normal">
      Using a pencil and paper, I sketched my final design using my favorite
      elements from my sketches.
    </p>

      class="sketchphoto"
    />
    <h3 class="part3 montserrat-normal">Low-fidelity Wireframing</h3>
    <p class="montserrat-normal">
      Next, I created a low-fidelity wireframe using Figma for each screensize (mobile, tablet, and desktop).
      I annotated where your wireframe solves those problems and describe how. The Figma link is 
      <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/abv0SrVkYW4PBMvb0D0M3B/CS1300-Mock?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=u62nmmDxiNFObrJu-1">here</a>
      there are 3 pages, one for each screen size.
    </p>
     <h3 class="part3 montserrat-normal">Visual Design Style Guide</h3>
    <p class="montserrat-normal">
      I created a visual design style guide that displays the main colors, typography, and resuable components of my design. The Figma link is 
      <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/abv0SrVkYW4PBMvb0D0M3B/CS1300-Mock?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=u62nmmDxiNFObrJu-1">here</a>
      The style guide is under the UI Style Guide page. 
    </p>
     <h3 class="part3 montserrat-normal">High-fidelity mockup</h3>
    <p class="montserrat-normal">
      Next, I created a high-fidelity wireframe using Figma for each screensize (mobile, tablet, and desktop).
      The Figma link is 
      <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/abv0SrVkYW4PBMvb0D0M3B/CS1300-Mock?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=u62nmmDxiNFObrJu-1">here</a>
      there are 3 pages, one for each screen size. Next to each low-fidelity mockup is the high-fidelity mockup.
    </p>
    <h2 class="part1 montserrat-normal">Responsive Redesign</h2>
    <p class="montserrat-normal">
      I created a responsive redesign of the website using HTML and CSS. The
      website is fully responsive and has a modern design. The website is
      pictured below.
    </p>
    <img

      <p class="montserrat-normal">The website is also linked <a href="https://awesome205.github.io/CS1300_responsive_redesign/">here.</a></p>
    <h2 class="part1 montserrat-normal">Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="montserrat-normal">
      In conclusion, I was able to identify usability problems with
      irishwrecksonline.net, visually redesign the website, and finally build
      the redesign using HTML and CSS. I learned a lot about the importance of
      usability and how to identify and solve usability problems. Overall, I learned a
      lot about web design and usability and I'm excited to continue learning
      more about web design and usability in the future :) </p>
